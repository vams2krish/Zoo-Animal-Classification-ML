# Zoo Animal Classification Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify zoo animals using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset containing various animal features to train and evaluate classification models.

## Input Data
The input data consists of animal characteristics like:
- hair
- feathers 
- eggs
- milk
- airborne
- aquatic
- predator
- toothed
- backbone
- breathes
- venomous
- fins
- legs
- tail
- domestic
- catsize

## Output
The output is a classification of the animal into categories like:
- Mammal
- Bird  
- Reptile
- Fish
- Amphibian
- Bug
- Invertebrate

## Key Components
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Feature selection
- Model training (likely using algorithms like decision trees, random forests, etc.)
- Model evaluation
- Prediction on new data

## Usage
The project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook. To use:
1. Load the data
2. Run the preprocessing and analysis cells
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate performance
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new animal data

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning classification techniques to zoological data. It can potentially be used to automatically categorize animals based on their characteristics.
